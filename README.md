# ❗CSC226 Project

**Term**: Spring 2021

**Author(s)**: Silas Fair

❗️indicates action items; you should remove these emoji as you complete/update the items which they accompany. (This means that your final README should have no ❗️in it!)

---

❗**References**: 
Throughout this project, you have likely used outside resources. Reference all ideas which are not your own, and describe how you integrated the ideas or code into your program. This includes online sources, people who have helped you, and any other resources that are not solely your own contribution. Update as you go.

## Milestone 1: Setup, Planning, Design

❗️**Title**: Rock Paper Scissors II

❗**Purpose**: Play a game of rock paper scissors lizard spock with the user

❗️**Sources**:  Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock A06.

❗️**Kanban Board**: https://trello.com/b/YKLXx2Ed/fairs-kanban-board

❗️**CRC Card**:
  - Please write a CRC card for a class that your project will implement.
  - See this link for a sample CRC card and a template to
  use for your own cards (you will have to make a copy to edit): https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JE_3Qmytk_JGztRqkPXWACJwciPH61VCx3idIlBCVFY/edit?usp=sharing
  - Tables in markdown are not easy, so we suggest saving your CRC card
  as an image and including the image(s) in the README. You can do this
  by saving an image in the repository and linking to it. See the sample CRC card below - and replace it with your own.

## Milestone 2: Code

No README action items. Keep your Kanban board up to date, and focus on your code. 🙃

## Milestone 3: Virtual Check-in

Indicates what percentage of the project you have left to complete, and how confident you are feeling. 

**Completion Percentage**: 95%

**Confidence**: I am confident that I will have the project finished by the deadline. I have made a working rock paper scissors spock game using classes. The code needs some cleaning up and I need to add two more simple functions for when the player or computer gets the score above 10 to show that they won. I need to make sure my code is a little cleaner and easier to parse.

## Milestone 4: Final Code, Presentation, Demo

### ❗User Instructions
In a paragraph, explain how to use your program. Assume the user is starting just after they hit the "Run" button. 

### ❗Errors and Constraints
Every program has bugs or features that had to be scrapped for time. Use this section to create a bullet list of all known errors and deficiencies that remain in your code. Bugs found that aren't acknowledged here will be penalized.

### ❗Reflection
In three to four well-written paragraphs, address the following (at a minimum):
- Why did you select the project that you did?
- How closely did your final project reflect your initial design?
- What did you learn from this process?
- What was the hardest part of the final project?
- What would you do differently next time, knowing what you know now?
